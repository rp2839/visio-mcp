# R24 — Aesthetic routing and explicit beautification

Status: **owner-approved direction; revised per review on issue #63. No implementation code written.** This implements the aesthetic-routing, crossing-policy, and Beautify scope of #63 after PR #90 (R26) merged. R19–R23 and R16/R29 remain authoritative for route stability, modes, obstacle policy, levels, joins, and hops.

## Goals and invariants

Ordinary edits continue to keep a clear stored route. A shape move, style change, load, projection, export, or inspection never beautifies a route. The aesthetic cost profile is used only by an explicit Beautify request. Crossing policy and priority affect that explicit operation only; setting them does not change ordinary routing costs or order. Ordinary routing always keeps R19 connector-ID ordering, so existing PSGL, Lego, R05 and R19 baselines do not move merely because R24 ships.

Hard feasibility is separate from aesthetic cost. Forbidden obstacles, endpoint glue, required endpoint sides, authored waypoints, R21 segment constraints, R16 joins, locked content and Frozen mode cannot be violated to improve appearance. A candidate that cannot satisfy hard constraints is skipped during Beautify; it does not reject valid changes to other targets. The same pure page-space planner and contact classifier feed the canvas, hidden projection, export, inspection, and transaction planner. Search has deterministic expansion budgets and stable ordering; budget exhaustion is reported and leaves that target unchanged.

## Shared connector-contact classification

PR #90 already implements the contact rules in `src/web/src/layout/inspectRoutes.ts`. R24 does not create another classifier. Now that #90 is merged, extract its pure contact geometry into `src/web/src/layout/routeContacts.ts`, preserving the existing `inspect_layout` finding codes and evidence. `inspectRoutes` and route scoring call this shared module. The shared result includes both connector IDs, segment indices, contact point or overlap interval, and the existing finding classification.

The shared contact rules distinguish perpendicular crossings (including hopped crossings), collinear overlaps, T-joins, unjoined endpoint contacts, and parallel near-misses. A declared R16 join is intentional and excluded from accidental crossing/overlap cost. A hop changes the drawing but not whether two routes cross. Contacts do not edit connector topology or create joins. Preserve R26's 0.5 pt overlap tolerance, 10 pt alongside minimum, and 4 pt near-miss threshold. Planner track spacing is 6 pt; it is a distinct placement target, not a change to the diagnostic threshold. The shape-clearance diagnostic uses R26's 4 pt threshold, and short-segment diagnostics use R26's 2 pt threshold.

Use **6 pt** as the planner's target track spacing. Keep R26 diagnostic thresholds and fixture results unchanged. Planner scoring and inspector findings share contact geometry and tolerance, while the 6 pt track target remains a separate aesthetic target.

## Deterministic score and routing order

The current A* cost remains unchanged for ordinary planning: **1 quality point per point of route length and 24 per bend**, plus the current shared-run cost. This is the compatibility path. R24's aesthetic profile is used only for explicit Beautify.

For each candidate route, compute this lexicographic score:

1. **Policy crossings:** count of accidental perpendicular crossings when the effective policy is `avoid`; `allow` sets this component to zero. A lower count always wins. T-joins, declared joins and contacts at a route's own endpoints do not count.
2. **Quality points:** sum of the terms below. Track quality dominates route deviation during explicit Beautify so overlapping routes can separate; route deviation remains a small tie-breaker that discourages needless movement.

| Term | Cost |
|---|---:|
| Symmetric route deviation from the stored path, measured as changed run length | 0.1 quality point / pt |
| Candidate route length | 1 quality point / pt |
| Bends | 24 quality points / bend |
| Collinear overlap with another connector | 20 quality points / pt of overlap |
| Near-miss track deficit | 2 quality points / pt², where deficit is `(6 pt - gap) × alongside length` |
| Crossing a measured text/connector label rectangle | 500 quality points / intersected label |
| Run closer than 4 pt to a non-end shape, while remaining outside the hard 8 pt clearance | 1 quality point / pt² of clearance deficit × alongside length |
| Each run shorter than 2 pt | 20 quality points / pt of `(2 - run length)` |
| Each route reversal (same axis, opposite direction, after a turn) | 100 quality points / reversal |

The stored route is retained unless the candidate improves the policy-crossing count or improves quality by at least **48 quality points** when crossing count is unchanged. This hysteresis equals the existing 48 pt two-turn route-stability threshold in quality-score units. Route deviation is the symmetric difference of the current and candidate route line sets: `length(current) + length(candidate) - 2 × sharedCollinearLength`, after merging collinear intervals. In A*, each added edge pays 0.1 quality point per point outside the stored route; completed-candidate scoring uses the exact symmetric difference. As a gating case, two 100 pt connectors sharing a run must be separated to 6 pt by Beautify: overlap reduction must outweigh the small deviation and jog costs.

Search uses a lexicographic pair `(policyCrossings, qualityPoints)`, so a route with fewer policy crossings always beats a shorter route with more crossings, including inside A*. A crossing is charged once per canonical contact with an already occupied connector; repeated search edges at the same geometric contact do not add duplicate cost. For `allow`, the crossing component is zero. Search-time quality costs are length, bend, overlap, near-miss and measured-label intersection. Symmetric route deviation, short-run, reversal and shape-clearance terms are computed for completed candidate paths. In aesthetic searches, add grid lines at each occupied orthogonal run's coordinate ±6 pt, in addition to obstacle-edge lines; legacy searches keep their current grid. The planner tests the current route plus one bounded A* candidate per target. If no candidate can be found within **80,000 expanded states per search**, that target is skipped with a budget-exhausted reason. Record expansion counts on the 60/60 fixture to ensure the added grid remains within budget.

Beautify routes eligible connectors in descending explicit `routingPolicy.priority` (default 0), then descending count of hard obstacles intersecting their direct path, then descending endpoint Manhattan span, then connector ID ascending. This puts congested/difficult routes on tracks first and uses stable IDs only as the final tie-break. Ordinary routing always keeps R19's connector-ID order regardless of configured policies. R29 `level` controls drawing order and pass-through; `routingPolicy.priority` controls explicit Beautify order only. During Beautify, unprocessed targets occupy their current routes; already processed targets occupy their proposed routes; non-target connectors always occupy their current routes.

Tracks are separated using 6 pt spacing and congestion cost across the full route, including the first and last 24 pt after existing endpoint anchors. The planner respects R22 preferred sides and R24 required sides; static named ports remain fixed. Symmetric redistribution of multiple dynamic glue anchors along a shape edge, group-wide alignment of port entries, and automatic creation of named ports are deferred; when existing anchors cannot provide separated fan-out, the planner reports residual congestion instead of changing glue or topology. Hops are still assigned by R16/R29 after route planning and do not alter the route score.

## Crossing policy and endpoint sides

Add optional `routingDefaults.crossing` to the document and `routingPolicy.crossing` to a connector, with `avoid | allow`; connector override wins. These values are read by explicit Beautify only and never alter ordinary routing. An explicit Beautify defaults to `avoid` when no policy is configured. `allow` permits and classifies crossings without penalizing them. **Approval-required crossings are deferred to R25**, which can carry stable proposal/approval identities; there is no approval-required enum or designated-area model in R24.

Add optional endpoint `requiredSide` (`north | east | south | west`) alongside R22's `preferredSide`. Side names are in the endpoint shape's local coordinates and rotate with the shape. A static named port takes precedence only when it is on the required side; a contradictory port request fails preflight with `invalid_request`, `details.reason = routing_side_conflict`, and the connector ID/endpoint. A valid required side that becomes unreachable because of hard obstacles produces `ROUTE_REQUIRED_SIDE_UNRESOLVED`; explicit creation or policy changes are rejected by the existing hard-route preflight. `preferredSide` remains a soft preference.

## Explicit Beautify preview and commit

The editor exposes read-only **Preview Beautify** for selected connector IDs or the full page. Preview returns the document revision, target IDs, exact proposed page-space routes, provenance/findings, skipped targets with reasons, and changed-route count. It draws proposed paths as an overlay and does not mutate the document or write route advisories.

Accept applies one atomic `beautify` transaction containing the preview's exact proposed route points and base revision. The transaction does not rerun route search or round coordinates; it verifies the revision, target eligibility, orthogonality, bounds, endpoint constraints and hard obstacle clearance, then applies those exact points. A stale revision or invalid proposed path rejects the entire transaction before mutation. The operation accepts explicit proposed routes from MCP callers without relying on an editor-only preview hash. Preview uses measured label rectangles to produce routes; commit preserves those exact points. One undo restores every changed route and advisory.

Untargeted connectors remain fixed and are treated as obstacles/tracks. The target list is exact; no neighboring connector is silently beautified. By default only automatic orthogonal connectors on unlocked content are eligible. Manual connectors are skipped unless the user explicitly chooses to convert included routes to Automatic; clearing their waypoints is part of the same transaction and undo. Frozen routes remain ineligible until the user separately changes them to Automatic, because R20 makes their stored advisory authoritative. Locked elements/layers remain hard protected and are reported as skipped, even when selected.

If a target has no feasible candidate, retain its existing route and advisory, report it as skipped, and continue with other targets. This operation does not trigger the broad R22 hard-route preflight failure for unrelated or skipped targets. Any attempted change that newly violates a hard obstacle or endpoint constraint is still rejected. A zero-change preview cannot be committed as a mutation.

## Contract and compatibility

Contract additions are optional: document `routingDefaults.crossing`; connector `routingPolicy.crossing` and integer `routingPolicy.priority` bounded to **-100..100**; endpoint `requiredSide`; a `setRoutingDefaults` transaction operation for the document default; and a transaction `beautify` operation carrying base revision, explicit proposed route points, `includeManual` and target IDs/page scope. The operation catalog and MCP descriptions document both operations and `ROUTE_REQUIRED_SIDE_UNRESOLVED`. A Beautify caller can submit exact routes; no preview hash is required. Add an Edit-menu **Routing defaults…** dialog and Inspector controls for connector crossing policy, priority and endpoint required side in a separate follow-up task after the Beautify workflow. Ordinary edits ignore crossing policy and priority for ordering and cost. Existing documents with no new values retain their serialized form and the existing implicit routing profile. No schema-version bump is proposed, consistent with R16/R20/R22/R23/R29. Older strict readers may reject files that use new fields, the known additive-field limitation. Native Visio export drops R24 routing policy fields because no cells are defined; import/export round-trip tests must assert route geometry is preserved and explicitly report those fields as dropped.

The editor preview is local to the app for R24. R24's `beautify` transaction is also available to MCP callers that supply exact proposed routes and a base revision. R25 can add a separate public proposal/approval workflow using this same classifier, cost profile and findings; it does not need a coordinate-rounded route hash.

## Acceptance and regression

- Unit-test the shared R26 classifier for each contact class, endpoint tolerance, declared R16 join, hopped crossing, and unchanged 4 pt near-miss/shape-clearance and 2 pt short-route thresholds. `inspect_layout` and scoring report the same contacts; Beautify targets 6 pt track spacing.
- Unit-test every score term, route-deviation measurement, 48-point hysteresis boundary, `avoid`/`allow`, explicit priority order, obstacle difficulty order, ID tie-break, stable route result, and bounded-budget outcome. Include 100 pt overlapping routes that Beautify separates by 6 pt, and a long crossing-free detour that beats a short crossing route inside A*.
- Verify ordinary planning produces byte-identical PSGL, Lego, R05 and R19 route geometry and change IDs, including after setting document or connector crossing policies and making an unrelated edit. Only explicit Beautify may change routes.
- Verify preview has no document side effects and returns exact proposed paths, counts and skip reasons. Include a measured label next to a route and assert that preview points equal committed points exactly. A changed base revision or invalid route rejects commit.
- Verify selected/page apply updates only eligible targets, continues past an infeasible target, commits once, and undo/redo restores advisories and paths exactly. Manual conversion is explicit and is rolled back for a skipped target; Frozen and locked content remain untouched. Unprocessed target routes stay occupied during search.
- Verify avoidable crossings are removed in `avoid`, allowed crossings remain disconnected and classified in `allow`, and hops are recomputed from final routes using unchanged R16/R29 rules.
- Run PSGL and Lego semantic/route/image regressions, the 60/60 stress fixture and denser bounded fixtures, route/planner/transaction/browser suites, schema/code-generation checks, and fresh Windows/Visio acceptance separately. Run a Visio round-trip with configured policy/priority/requiredSide and verify routes survive while unsupported R24 fields are reported as dropped. Measure explicit Beautify preview time and state expansions; do not change the existing 80,000-state deterministic limit to chase a timing target.

## Deliberate limits

R24 does not add approval-required crossings or standalone designated-region objects (R25 follow-up); automatic redistribution of dynamic glue anchors, group-wide port-entry alignment, or named-port creation; new topology or junction semantics; the R21 segment editor; R26 overlay redesign; or R27 Visio crossing cells. It preserves R26 finding meanings and thresholds. If the 60/60 or denser page exceeds the deterministic state budget, affected routes are skipped with a finding and the rest of the preview remains usable.
